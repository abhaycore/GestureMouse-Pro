# GestureMouse Pro 🖐️🖱️

A real-time AI-powered virtual mouse controller built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe that lets users control their computer cursor using hand gestures through a webcam.

GestureMouse Pro transforms hand movements into smooth mouse interactions including cursor movement, left click, right click, scrolling, pause mode, and drag-and-drop — all without touching a physical mouse.

# 🔥 Advanced Features

## Palm-Center Cursor Tracking
Instead of tracking fingertip movement, the cursor follows the palm center for improved click stability and smoother motion.

## Smart Drag Detection
The system intelligently differentiates between:

- Pause Intent
- Drag Intent

using movement thresholds and hold timers.

## FPS Auto Protection
If FPS drops below a safe threshold, the system automatically pauses to prevent accidental cursor behavior.

# 🧩 Requirements

- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Webcam
- Good lighting conditions

---

# ⚠️ Troubleshooting

## Camera Not Opening

- Check webcam permissions
- Verify `CAMERA_INDEX` in `config.py`
- Close other apps using the camera

---

## Cursor Feels Laggy

Increase:

```python
SMOOTHING_FACTOR
MOVE_SENSITIVITY
```

inside `config.py`

---

## Clicks Not Registering

- Improve lighting
- Move hand closer to camera
- Reduce pinch distance threshold

---

## Cursor Shaking

- Keep hand steady
- Ensure background is not cluttered
- Lower movement sensitivity slightly

---

# 📈 Future Improvements
